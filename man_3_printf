.SH NAME
.B _printf
- formated output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
To use this function the #include "main.h" header is needed.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf() function produces output according to a format which is described
below. This function write its output to the stdout, the standard output stream.
.SH USAGE
To use _printf you have to use the following key characters preceeded by % symbol.
.RS 3
%c: To be used to print characters
.RS 0
%s: To be used to print strings
.RS 0
%d: To print integers of max and min size of an int type
.RS 0
%i: To print integers of max and min size of an int type
.RS 0
%b: To print a number in binary form
.SH RETURN VALUES
The _printf() function returns an integer representing the number of symbols
printed not counting \\0 for the string.
.SH NOTES
_printf uses a custom character printing function called _putchar, that uses the system call write(). 
_putchar uses a static buffer of 1024 bytes and a static incrementing variable. 
That way, everytime _putchar is called inside _printf, the character is stored inside the buffer and the function moves to the next character, 
until _printf calls _putchar(-1), which \(dqflushes\(dq the buffer and resets the incrementing variable to 0. 
That way, _putchar only needs to call write one time, passing to it the whole buffer and the number of bytes in it, which is given by the value of the incrementing variable.
